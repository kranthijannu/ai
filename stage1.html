                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or systems 
                        that can simulate human intelligence. This means enabling machines to think, learn, and act in ways that mimic 
                        human abilities like reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In simple terms, AI empowers machines to 
                        perform tasks faster and more efficiently than humans.

                    <h1>Brief History of AI</h1>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a rich history that spans decades, with groundbreaking milestones shaping its development and adoption. Here's an in-depth look at how AI evolved over the years:</p>
                    
                    <h2>1950s: The Birth of AI</h2>
                    <p>The concept of machine intelligence emerged in the 1950s, thanks to visionary thinkers like <strong>Alan Turing</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Alan Turing's Contribution:</strong>
                            <p>Turing proposed the idea that machines could "think" and perform tasks like humans. He introduced the <strong>Turing Test</strong>, a way to measure a machine's intelligence. If a machine could hold a conversation indistinguishable from a human, it would pass the test.</p>
                            <p>Example: If you chat with a computer program and can't tell whether it's a human or a machine, that program would pass the Turing Test.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This decade laid the theoretical foundation for AI, planting the seeds for future innovations.</p>

                    <h2>1956: The Dartmouth Conference</h2>
                    <p>This year marked the official birth of Artificial Intelligence as a field of study.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A group of researchers, including <strong>John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon</strong>, gathered at Dartmouth College to discuss the potential of machines that could "think."</li>
                        <li>During this conference, <strong>John McCarthy</strong> coined the term <strong>"Artificial Intelligence"</strong> to describe this emerging field.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong><br>
                    The conference brought AI into the academic spotlight, setting the stage for research and development.</p>

                    <h2>1970s-1980s: The AI Winter</h2>
                    <p>The initial excitement around AI led to high expectations, but progress was slow due to technical limitations and lack of funding.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Limited computational power to process complex algorithms</li>
                                <li>Lack of sufficient data to train machines</li>
                                <li>Overpromising results that failed to materialize, leading to reduced investments</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>"AI Winter":</strong> This term refers to periods of stagnation in AI research when enthusiasm and funding dried up.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite the setbacks, researchers continued to explore AI, creating small but meaningful advancements.</p>

                    <h2>1997: IBM's Deep Blue Triumph</h2>
                    <p>AI returned to the spotlight with IBM's <strong>Deep Blue</strong>, a chess-playing computer.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> Deep Blue defeated <strong>Garry Kasparov</strong>, the reigning world chess champion, in a series of matches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Significance:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Demonstrated the power of AI to tackle complex, strategic tasks</li>
                                <li>Proved machines could outperform humans in specific domains with proper programming</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This victory was a milestone that reignited global interest in AI and its potential.</p>

                    <h2>2010s: The AI Boom</h2>
                    <p>The 2010s witnessed a revolution in AI, driven by advancements in <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong> technologies.</p>
